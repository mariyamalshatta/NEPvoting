# NEPvoting
test wether voting depends on the opinion on NEP

**Context**
The education system is running on the traditional approaches and methodologies for more than three decades. Technological advancement with the emergence of the Internet has changed the whole world but the ladder to reach that advancement was not modified. The government has recently framed and approved the new educational policy (NEP-2020) to take forward the education system toward International standards.

**Objective**

A survey was done, after the draft National Education Policy 2020 was published in a country, with 577 college teachers. Each of them was asked whether they voted for the ruling party in 2019 or not and whether they are in favor of or against the NEP. Using the survey data, can we say with statistical evidence that voting preference is not independent of opinion on NEP?
